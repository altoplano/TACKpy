TACK-tool version VV.VV.VV

Quick start 
------------ 
Run "TACK.py new <sslcert>" on your SSL cert. Backup the TACK key in a safe
place where no one can steal it and you won't lose it. Add the TACK cert to
your SSL chain (in Apache, append it to the SSLCertificateChainFile).

You will need to update the TACK cert whenever you change your SSL cert. Run
"TACK.py update <new_sslcert>" on your new SSL cert from the directory
containing the old TACK cert and the TACK key.

If you have multiple sites create a different directory for each site, and
perform the commands in each directory.


Advanced uses
==============

Key reuse
----------
To reuse a TACK key for multiple sites specify it via the "--key" argument to
"new" and "update".


Manual naming
--------------
By default the tool looks for files in the current directory with the "TACK_"
name and increments the TACK cert name while making backups.

If you'd prefer to manually specify filenames use the "--in", "--out", "--key",
and "--out_key" arguments. I.e.:
  TACK.py new <sslcert> --out=cert.pem --out_key=key.pem
  TACK.py update <new_sslcert> --key=key.pem --in=cert.pem --out=cert2.pem
