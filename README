Quick start 
------------ 
Run "TACK.py new <sslcert>" on your SSL cert. Backup the TACK key in a safe
place where no one can steal it and you won't lose it. Add the TACK cert to
your SSL chain (in Apache, append it to the SSLCertificateChainFile).

You will need to update the TACK cert whenever you change your SSL cert, or
once a year, whichever is sooner. Run "TACK.py update <new_sslcert>" on your
new SSL cert from a directory containing the old TACK cert and the TACK key.
