Abstract

   This document defines TACK, a TLS Extension that enables a TLS server
   to assert the authenticity of its public key.  A TACK contains a
   "TACK signing key" and a corresponding "TACK signature" over the
   public key from the TLS server's certificate.  Hostnames can be
   "pinned" to a TACK key.  TLS connections to a pinnned hostname are
   only considered verified if the server presents a valid signature
   from the pinned key.

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys       April 2012


1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, a TLS client verifies a TLS server's public key using
   a certificate chain issued by some public CA.  TACK facilitates
   stronger methods of verifying server public keys.

   One such method is for clients to employ "pinning", in which the
   client uses past connections to verify future connections by checking
   for some constant element.  Unfortunately, a number of problems arise
   when attempting to pin certificate chains: the TLS servers at a given
   hostname may have different certificate chains and may change their
   chains at any time; the "more constant" elements of a chain - the CAs
   - may not be trustworthy; and the client may be oblivious to key
   compromise events which render the pinned data untrustworthy.

   TACK addresses these problems by having the site sign its TLS server
   public keys with a "TACK key".  This enables clients to "pin" a
   hostname to the TACK key without requiring sites to modify their
   existing certificate chains, and without limiting a site's
   flexibility to deploy different certificate chains on different
   servers or change certificate chains at any time.  Since TACK pins
   are based on TACK keys (instead of CA keys), trust in CAs is not
   required.  Additionally, the TACK key may be used to revoke previous
   TACK signatures or even itself, to handle compromise of TLS or TACK
   private keys.

   If requested, a compliant server will send a TLS Extension containing
   its "TACK".  Inside the TACK is a TACK public key and TACK signature.
   Once a client has seen the same (hostname, TACK public key) pair
   multiple times, the client will "activate" a pin between the hostname
   and TACK key for a period equal to the length of time the pair has
   been observed for.  This "pin activation" process limits the impact
   of bad pins resulting from transient network attacks or operator
   error.

   TACK pins are easily communicated between clients.  For example, a
   TACK client may scan the internet to discover TACK pins, then publish
   these pins for other clients to rely upon.

3.  Overview

3.1.  TACK life cycle

   A server operator using TACK may perform several processes:

   Selection of a TACK key:  The server operator first chooses the ECDSA
      signing key to use for a set of hostnames.

   Creating initial TACKs under a TACK key:  The TACK private key is
      then used to sign the TLS public keys for all servers associated
      with those hostnames.  The TACK public key and signature are
      combined with some metadata into each server's "TACK".

   Deploying initial TACKs:  For each hostname, TACKs are deployed to
      TLS servers in a two-stage process.  First, each TLS server
      associated with the hostname is given a TACK.  Once this is
      completed, pin activation is enabled on the servers.

   Creating new TACKs under a TACK key:  A TACK must be replaced
      whenever a server changes its TLS public key, or when the TACK
      expires.  TACKs may also need to be replaced with later-generation
      TACKs if the TACK key's "min_generation" is updated (see next).

   Revoking old TACKs:  If a TLS private key is compromised, the
      affected TACKs can be revoked by publishing a new TACK containing
      a higher "min_generation".

   Revoking TACK keys:  If a TACK private key is compromised, or a
      server operator wishes to stop using TACK for any reason, a server
      can revoke an entire TACK key (including all TACKs and pins
      referring to it) by publishing a "break signature".

3.2.  Pin life cycle

   A TACK client maintains a store of pins for verifying TLS
   connections.  Pins associate a hostname and a TACK key.  When a
   client sees a new hostname and TACK key combination, an inactive pin
   is created.  Once the client has seen the pin more than once, the pin
   is "activated" for a period equal to the timespan between the first
   time the pin was seen and the most recent time, up to a maximum
   period of 30 days.

   Pin activation serves multiple purposes.  First, it prevents an
   attacker with short-lived control of the hostname from setting long-
   lived pins.  Second, it makes it safer for sites to experiment with
   TACKs, as a new TACK can be discarded without causing long-lived
   problems.  The 30 day limit guarantees that a worst-case pin can be
   recovered from in reasonable time.

   In addition to creating and activating pins, a TLS connection can
   alter the clients's pin store by publishing revocation data:

   Min_generation:  Each pin stores the highest "min_generation" value
      it has seen from the pinned TACK key, and rejects TACKs from
      earlier generations.

   Break signatures:  A TLS handshake may send break signatures which
      cause all pins for the broken key to be discarded.

4.  TACK Extension

4.1.  Definition of TACK_Extension

   A new TLS ExtensionType ("tack") is defined and MAY be included by a
   TLS client in the ClientHello message defined in [RFC5246].

   enum {tack(TBD), (65535)} ExtensionType;

   The "extension_data" field of this ClientHello SHALL be empty.  A TLS
   server which is not resuming a TLS session MAY respond with an
   extension of type "tack" in the ServerHello.  The "extension_data"
   field of this ServerHello SHALL contain a "TACK_Extension", as
   defined below using the TLS presentation language from [RFC5246].

   enum (disabled(0), enabled(1)} TACK_Activation;

   struct {
      opaque public_key[64];
      uint8  min_generation;
      uint8  generation;
      uint32 expiration;
      opaque target_hash[32];
      opaque signature[64];
   } TACK;  /* 166 bytes */

   struct {
      opaque public_key[64];
      opaque signature[64];
   } TACK_Break_Sig;  /* 128 bytes */

   struct {
      TACK tack<0...166>  /* 0 or 1 TACK */
      TACK_Break_Sig  break_sigs<0...1024>  /* 0...8 Break Sigs */
      TACK_Activation pin_activation;
   } TACK_Extension;

4.2.  Explanation of TACK_Extension fields

4.2.1.  TACK fields

   public_key:  This field specifies the TACK's public key.  The field
      contains a pair of integers (x, y) representing a point on the
      elliptic curve P-256 defined in [FIPS186-3].  Each integer is
      encoded as a 32-byte octet string using the Integer-to-Octet-
      String algorithm from [RFC6090], and these strings are
      concatenated with the x value first.  (NOTE: This is equivalent to
      an uncompressed subjectPublicKey from [RFC5480], except that the
      initial 0x04 byte is omitted).

   min_generation:  This field publishes a min_generation value.

   generation:  This field assigns each TACK a generation.  Generations
      less than a published min_generation are considered revoked.

   expiration:  This field specifies a time after which the TACK is
      considered expired.  The time is encoded as the number of minutes,
      excluding leap seconds, after midnight UTC, January 1 1970.

   target_hash:  This field is a hash of the TLS server's
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] using the SHA256 algorithm from
      [FIPS180-2].  The SubjectPublicKeyInfo is typically conveyed as
      part of the server's X.509 certificate.

   signature:  This field is an ECDSA signature by the TACK's public key
      over the 13 byte ASCII string "TACK_tack_sig" followed by the
      entire TACK structure prior to the "signature" field (i.e. the
      preceding 102 bytes).  The field contains a pair of integers (r,
      s) representing an ECDSA signature as defined in [FIPS186-3],
      using curve P-256 and SHA256.  Each integer is encoded as a 32-
      byte octet string using the Integer-to-Octet-String algorithm from
      [RFC6090], and these strings are concatenated with the r value
      first.

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys       April 2012


4.2.2.  TACK_Break_Sig fields

   public_key:  This field specifies the TACK key being broken, and
      supplies the public key used to verify the following signature.
      The key is encoded as per TACK.public_key.

   signature:  This field is an ECDSA signature by the TACK_Break_Sig's
      public key over the 14 byte ASCII string "TACK_break_sig" followed
      by the entire TACK_Break_Sig structure prior to the "signature"
      field (i.e. the preceding 64 bytes).  The field contains a pair of
      integers (r, s) representing an ECDSA signature as defined in
      [FIPS186-3], using curve P-256 and SHA256.  It is calculated and
      encoded as per TACK.signature.

4.2.3.  TACK_Extension fields

   tack:  This field provides the server's TACK.  It MAY be empty, or
      may contain a TACK.

   break_sigs:  This field provides break signatures.  It MAY be empty,
      or MAY contain up to 8 break signatures.

   pin_activation:  If this field is "enabled", this TACK_Extension MAY
      be used by clients to activate or extend the activation of TACK
      pins.  This field is typically toggled from a disabled to an
      enabled state once TACKs have been deployed to all TLS servers for
      a hostname.

   Note that both the "tack" and "break_sigs" fields MAY be empty.

5.  Client processing

5.1.  TACK pins, key records, and host records

   A client supporting TACK SHALL have a local store of pins, consisting
   of "key records" and "host records".  Each host record is associated
   with a key record.  Multiple host records may be associated with one
   key record.  A "pin" refers to a (host record, key record) pair.

   A "key record" contains:

      TACK public key (or hash): A public key or a cryptographically-
      secure, second preimage-resistant hash of a public key.  A client
      SHALL NOT store multiple key records referencing the same public
      key.

      Min_generation: A single byte used to detect revoked TACKs.

   A "host record" contains:

      Hostname: A DNS hostname.  A client SHALL NOT store multiple host
      records with the same hostname.  A pin containing the current TLS
      connection's hostname is a "relevant" pin.

      Initial timestamp: A timestamp noting when this pin was created.

      Active period end: Empty or a timestamp.  If empty or set to a
      time in the past, the pin is "inactive".  If set to a future time,
      the pin is "active" until that time.

5.2.  High-level client processing

   A TACK client SHALL send the "tack" extension defined previously, as
   well as the "server_name" extension from [RFC6066] indicating the
   hostname the client is contacting.

   If not resuming a session, the server MAY respond with a
   TACK_Extension.  If so, the TACK client SHALL perform the following
   steps prior to using the TLS connection:

   1.  Discard pins based on break signatures (if present).

   2.  Check for a valid TACK.

   3.  Update and activate pins based on the valid TACK (if present).

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys       April 2012


   If, after the above steps, there is a relevant active pin and a valid
   TACK, then the connection is verified by the pin.  If there is a
   relevant active pin but no valid TACK, the connection is rejected by
   the pin.  A rejected connection may indicate a network attack or some
   other communication failure, and a client SHOULD NOT send or receive
   data on such a connection.

5.3.  Client processing details

5.3.1.  Discarding pins based on break signatures

   All key records broken by break signatures SHALL be discarded, along
   with their associated host records.  A key record is broken by a
   break signature if the following is true of the break signature:

   1.  The "public_key" is referenced by the key record.

   2.  The "signature" is a correct ECDSA signature.

5.3.2.  Checking for a valid TACK

   A TACK is "valid" if the below checks are true.

   1.  The "public_key" is referenced by the relevant active pin's key
       record, or there is no relevant active pin.

   2.  The "generation" is >= "min_generation".

   3.  The "generation" is >= the "min_generation" of any key record in
       the client's store which references the TACK's public key.

   4.  The "expiration" is non-expired.

   5.  The "target_hash" is equal to the SHA256 hash of the server's
       SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   6.  The "signature" is a correct ECDSA signature.

   7.  The TLS handshake completes successfully.

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys       April 2012


5.3.3.  Updating and activating pins based on the TACK

   A valid TACK is used to update the client's pin store.  If there is a
   key record referencing the TACK key, the key record's min_generation
   SHALL be set to the TACK's min_generation if it is larger.

   A valid TACK MAY also be used to modify the host records using the
   "pin activation" process described below.  Note that the following
   steps are optional; a client MAY rely on an external source of pins.

   If there is a relevant pin and the TACK Extension's "pin_activation"
   is enabled, the host record's "active period end" MAY be set
   according to the following formula (where "current" is the current
   time, and "initial" is the "initial timestamp" from the host record):

   active_period_end = current + MIN(30 days, current - initial)

   If there is no relevant pin, or an inactive one not referencing the
   TACK key, a new pin MAY be created with the following steps:

   1.  If the TACK key is referenced by an existing key record, the key
       record is reused, otherwise a new key record is created with the
       TACK's key and min_generation.

   2.  A new host record is created containing the server's hostname, an
       "initial timestamp" equal to the current time, and an empty
       "active period end".

   3.  If there was an existing relevant host record, it is discarded.

   The following table summarizes this behavior based on whether the
   relevant pin is active and references the TACK's public key.  The
   "(*)" means "if TACK_Extension.pin_activation is enabled".

   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Pin status | Pin references TACK | Result                        |
   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Active     | Yes                 | Extend activation period (*)  |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Active     | No                  | Rejected                      |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Inactive   | Yes                 | Activate pin (*)              |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Inactive   | No                  | Replace with new inactive pin |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | None       | -                   | Create new inactive pin       |
   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+

5.3.4.  Deleting pins asynchronously

   A client MAY delete pins from its local store at any time, whether to
   save space, protect privacy, or for any other reason.  To delete a
   pin, its host record SHALL be removed.  If this leaves a key record
   with no associated host records, the key record MAY be removed as
   well.  Pins may be deleted regardless of whether they are active or
   inactive.

   Deleting pins obviously reduces the benefits of TACK, so SHOULD be
   avoided.

6.  TACK IDs

   A "TACK ID" MAY be used to represent a TACK public key to users in a
   form that is relatively easy to visually compare and transcribe.  A
   TACK ID consists of five groups of five alphanumeric characters, each
   group separated by periods.  The first character is set to "b" to
   differentiate this TACK ID from any future TACK IDs defined by later
   specifications (see Section 8.1), which should use "c", "d", etc.
   The remaining 24 alphanumeric characters are the base32 encoding of
   the first 120 bits of SHA256(TACK public_key).  Base32 encoding is as
   specified in [RFC4648], except lowercase is used.

   Example TACK IDs:

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys       April 2012


7.  Advice

7.1.  For server operators

   Key reuse:  All servers that are pinned to a single key are able to
      impersonate each other (in other words: a TACK from one server
      could match a pin from any other).  Thus, different keys should be
      used to pin hostnames with different security properties.

   Generations:  To revoke older generations of TACKs, the server
      operator should first provide all servers with a new generation of
      TACKs, then provide servers with new TACKs containing the new
      min_generation.  This is safer then trying to update
      min_generation and generation simultaneously across a range of
      servers, since a client may receive a min_generation update from
      one server but then try to contact an older-generation server
      which has not yet been updated.

   Signature expiration:  It is convenient to set the TACK signature
      expiration equal to the end-entity certificate expiration, so that
      the TACK and certificate may both be replaced at the same time.
      Alternatively, short-lived TACK signatures may be used so that a
      compromised TLS private key has limited value to an attacker.

   Break signatures:  Break signatures are useful if a server wishes to
      abruptly change its TACK key, stop using TACKs, or advertise that
      a TACK key is compromised and clients should stop relying on it.
      A break signature only needs to be published for a time interval
      equal to the maximum active period of any affected pins.  For
      example, if a TACK has been only been published on a website for
      24 hours, removing the TACK requires only publishing the break
      signature for 24 hours.

   Pin activation:  The pin_activation field should only be toggled to
      "enabled" once all TLS servers sharing the same hostname have a
      valid TACK.  Otherwise, a client may activate a pin by contacting
      one server, then contact a different server at the same hostname
      that does not yet have a valid TACK.  The pin_activation field can
      also be used to phase out use of TACKs for a hostname - if all
      servers at a hostname disable pin activation, existing pins will
      eventually all become deactivated (within 30 days at most).

7.2.  For client implementors

   Sharing pin information:  It is possible for a client to maintain a
      pin store based entirely on its own TLS connections.  However,
      such a client runs the risk of creating incorrect pins, failing to
      keep its pins active, or failing to receive revocation information
      (min_generation updates and break signatures).  Clients are
      advised to collaborate so that pin data can be aggregated and
      shared.  This will likely require additional protocols and
      infrastructure outside the scope of this document.

8.  Security considerations

   All servers sharing a TACK key can impersonate each other.  Use
   different TACK keys for servers with different security properties.

   Make backup copies of the TACK private key and keep all copies in
   secure locations where they can't be compromised.

   A TACK private key MUST NOT be used to perform any non-TACK
   cryptographic operations.  For example, using a TACK elliptic curve
   key for email encryption, code-signing, or any other purpose MUST NOT
   be done.

   HTTP cookies [RFC6265] set by a pinned host can be stolen by a
   network attacker who can forge web and DNS responses so as to cause a
   client to send the cookies to a phony subdomain of the pinned host.
   To prevent this, TACK HTTPS Servers SHOULD set the "secure" attribute
   and omit the "domain" attribute on all security-sensitive cookies,
   such as session cookies.  These attribute settings tell the browser
   that the cookie should only be presented back to the originating host
   (not its subdomains), and should only be sent over HTTPS (not HTTP)
   [RFC6265].

8.1.  Note on algorithm agility

   If the need arises for TACKs using different cryptographic algorithms
   (e.g., if SHA256 or ECDSA are shown to be weak), a "v2" version of
   TACKs could be defined, requiring assignment of a new TLS Extension
   number.  TACKs as defined in this document would then be known as
   "v1" TACKs.

9.  IANA considerations

9.1.  New entry for the TLS ExtensionType Registry

   IANA is requested to add an entry to the existing TLS ExtensionType
   registry, defined in RFC 5246, for tack(TBD) as defined in this
   document.
